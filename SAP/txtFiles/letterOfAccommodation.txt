<h1>Letter of Accommodation</h1>
Your Letter of Accommodation informs your course instructor(s) about your accommodations needs in the classroom so that they can better meet your needs.<br>
The Letter maintains confidentiality about the nature of your disability, but informs an instructor about a studentâ€™s relevant accommodations.<br>
<br>
For example, your instructor needs to know:
<ul>
  <li>What accommodations you may need in class</li>
  <li>To send a test to the Test and Exam Centre</li>
  <li>To approve specific test and exam accommodations</li>
</ul>
