<h1>Verification of Illness</h1>
If you need a “doctor’s note” to verify that you have been ill or injured, you need the Verification of Student Illness or Injury Form. This is the new official University of Toronto form for all students who are requesting special academic consideration based on illness or injury.  This new form replaces the "Student Medical Certificate".
<br>
Please provide the form below to your Physician, Surgeon, Nurse Practitioner, Registered Psychologist, or Dentist for completion.
<br>
The form can only be completed by the following practitioners:
<ul>
<li>Dental Surgeon (Dentist) registered with the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario</li>
<li>Nurse or Nurse Practitioner registered with the College of Nurses of Ontario</li>
