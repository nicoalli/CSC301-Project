Product Name: Student Accessibility Portal (SAP)

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: February 8th 2018
 * Where: Tutorial room (LM 155)

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

1. Deciding to use Slack as main communication method
We are able to put all of our documents in an organized manner where we are also able to communicate in one common environment
We have different channels for each topic, so that ideas don’t get lost in the midst of many messages

2. Productive meetings
We were able to find a common time to meet up (Thursdays before the Tutorial)
This allowed us to be productive and to be able to use our time well
Also convenient, as we had tutorial after and able to communicate with the TA with the concerns that were brought up in our meetings
Refer to meeting documents in iteration01-plan.md

3. Working individually on different tasks and reviewing together
Used our time efficiently where we worked and discussed together verbally on how to solve each task so everyone knew the product and everyone was on the same page
Tasks were then worked on individually to maximize our time and to complete each component before the deadline
Allowed everyone to feel included by being able to complete one part by themselves
Reviewed all of our work together to make sure that everyone is on the same page and satisfied with everyone’s work. Also, we polished all our work together before submitting.

4. Deciding to use Google Docs as our main way to collaborate on documents together

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Group Call for a meeting
It was difficult to plan one common time other than our Thursday meetup so we resorted to online discussions throughout the iteration

2. Tutorial Room Layout
When signing up for tutorial rooms, we got assigned to the room in Lash Miller despite choosing another room
Every meeting, we have to rearrange the chairs which takes up some of our meeting time
We also have trouble discussing throughout the meeting as the room is confined and not comfortable and the voice levels are very high

#### Planned changes

The only change we are going to make for the future iterations is to add a code review meeting as our iteration meetings now work well with our group


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. Created Google documents to record possible problem domains: list out problems group members are interested in, background information, outcome of research, potential solution and proposal.

2. Decide how our product works for one specific use case (the flow of usability of our product/how the user interacts with the product)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. Created detailed wireframe of main pages (ie. How our log in or home page would look like with colours and proper layout).
  We decided it was more important to have a sketch of all pages and decide on how the user interacts so we did not get to this in time

2. Determine categories/nodes of our graphs through researching the specific pathways to complete a task.
  We were unable to complete because we would need to actually sign up for some of these services so we need to do further research by asking administrators at accessibility services which takes awhile and so unable to do it by iteration deadline

## Meeting Highlights

1. We decided how we would implement our UI (see mockups)

2. We decided on product pages, which are:
Log in, Personalized graph/main page, All services graph, Search results, Category page (which is a detailed graph specific to one task), and Profile page

3. Decided to prioritize features for the personas we created so for future iterations we will look into and implement tasks specific to these use cases
