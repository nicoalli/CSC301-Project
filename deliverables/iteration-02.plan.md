# Student Accessibility Portal (SAP)

## Iteration 2 

 * Start date: Thursday February 8th, 2018
 * End date: Thursday March 8th, 2018

## Process

For this iteration, we will have weekly meetings all documented in our Google Drive that will state milestones and tasks that will need to be completed for each week. Each week, we will check in on the status of everyone’s task on Tuesday over the web which will then be followed by meeting in person on Thursdays to review the completion of our tasks as well as any outstanding issues. Our goal for this iteration is to complete the Front End of our Student Accessibility Service website.

On our first week, we plan on setting up the environment and agreeing on the platform that this website will be developed in, as well as finalizing our wireframes. 

For the second week, we plan on finishing the basic high fidelty wireframe of each page of our website with minimal styling. 

In the last and third week, we plan on adding style to make all pages look uniform and also integrating and linking all the pages together in order to film the demo. In the last week, we will discuss future steps and plan how to implement our Back End in deliverable 3.

#### Roles & responsibilities

All team members are assigned page(s) to develop. Each sub-team/pair is responsible for transforming the mockup into a static front end page with clickable elements.

- Bernadine and Nicole -> All Services page, Personal Graph/Main page, and Navigation Bar
- Nora and Merci -> Category graph page
- KC and Andre -> Login page

In addition to this, we assigned the following roles:

- KC and Andre -> Research and Data Collection, they are responsible for determining which categories we will include in our graphs or any other information about accessibility services around UofT. They will also determine which services are connected to each category, this will be the leaf nodes of our graph. Additionally, they will be designing our databases for the next iteration.

- Bernadine -> Project Manager. She is responsible for ensuring that we follow and complete goals and tasks that we set during our planning meetings. She is also who we will go to when we have a question about the overall product such as what we need to develop and when we need to complete it by. Another responsibility is to set the agenda for each meeting.

- Nicole -> Technical Expert. She is responsible for any questions about the code or any of the languages and frameworks that we use. She will also set up the structure of the web application and any dependencies or scripts that are needed. In addition, she will do code reviews. 

- Nora and Merci -> Product Owners. They are responsible for ensuring that each member who is developing is keeping the user in mind, this makes sure that we keep our product user friendly and solve the problems of our target users. They are also responsible for testing the product and catching any bugs.

#### Artifacts

- Documentation of our meetings will all be in Google Drive which will all be linked in review.md. This will be used to keep track of what is done and what needs to be done after each meeting.
  * within this document we will have a to do list, schedule, and a table that marks the current status of a task (ie. in progress, not started, complete)
- All tasks in our meeting documents will have deadlines and will be ranked with priorities to make sure we meet our milestones. Our product managers will be in charge of determining the tasks and assigning priorities.
- All tasks will be evenly assigned to pairs in the team based on skills and interest. If there are any issues or conflicts that arise, our project manager will mediate and assign the tasks.
- Slack channel will be used to contact the team for any needs and/or issues throughout the iteration.


#### Git / GitHub workflow

- One person will create the basic structure of the project on GitHub and set up the initial environment
- Our group will then be divided into 3 pairs and each pair will have their own fork of the master repository and are assigned Github issues/tasks to work on 
- After completing their part, the sub-team will close their Github issues and will open a pull-request but only after reviewing changes as a pair in a meeting (either online or in person)
  * any conflicts with the pull-request should be fixed by this pair during this meeting
- In person, a member who isn’t part of the pair will review the code then after the review, if it is good, they will merge code to the master repo, if it isn’t then the pair will fix their code during the meeting and submit another pull request
- We chose this workflow because we could make sure each pair’s part works before including it in master. This ensures master is our "source of truth" and does not havy any bugs. Also, having someone from outside the pair review the code is helpful because this increases the change of catching any bugs.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

Our overall goal for this iteration is complete the front end of our product with the ability to navigate through the website with static web pages with temporary data.

The items are ordered in chronological order of which tasks need to be completed based on deadlines and importance:

- Fill out plan.md on February 8th
- Plan the front end and assign tasks to each pair
- Determine github workflow: consider forking then merge together (like the assignment)
- Determine structure of files (MVC) by February 15
- Finish and send Nav Bar and headers for everybody’s page (Nicole and Nadine) by Monday, March 5
- Finish all polished front end pages by Tuesday, March 6
- Create a voice over script for video by Tuesday, March 6 (Everyone)
- Film a video of the workflow of our prototype on Wednesday, March 7
- Link all of the nodes and pages properly on Tuesday, March 6
- Film the introduction skit for the video on Thursday, March 8
- Fill out iteration.md on Thursday, March 8
- Combine and put together our deliverable submission Thursday, March 8
- Commit and merge on Github on Friday, March 9

#### Artifacts

- All code will be uploaded to our team repo so that it is accessible to us and the TAs
- We will create a node.js server so that we can test and run our product. This is important because we want to be able to navigate the website as if we were the target users.
- Github issues will be created so that coding tasks will be transparent and organized for all team members. This also allows us to keep track of the status of each task assigned.
- Mock ups of our website can be found in our previous iteration/deliverable.
- We will create a video to demonstrate the product. The video can be found in review.md when completed
- Screen caps of website features that was not captured in our video will be added in review.md artifacts. This is so that the graders can see all aspects of our product that have been completed.
- Styling Guidelines will also be added to review.md when finalized. Since we are focusing on front end this allows us to have a set of rules to follow when desigining the pages.
