## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, March 29, 2018
 * Where: Tutorial Room (LM155)

## Process - Reflection

For this iteration we were able to complete all tasks assigned in the planning meeting and successfully created the back end of our product. We were also able to integrate it with the front end with ease. Through this process we found that meeting twice a week in person and assigning specific roles for each member as well as tasks to complete for each week was important for keeping organized. GitHub issues and code reviews were critical for meeting our goals. Additionally, documenting our meetings was a key element for the success of this iteration, we were able to stick to our goals and kept us responsible for any deadlines and tasks. Overall, we are happy with the product that came out of our hard work and time.

#### Decisions that turned out well

- Create git issues and assign to pairs
  * Everyone has a clear understand of unfinished and finished tasks. This prevented any overlap in working on the same features.
  * Priority tags helps keeping track of importance and priority of unfinished tasks and issues.
  * Helps us keep track of our progress. This was critical to helping us manage our time.
- Frequent meetings (at least twice a week + tutorial time)
  * This ensured we were all up to date on the status of the product
  * It kept us accountable and responsible for all tasks we needed to do as well as address issues right away instead of having to delay it any further
  * Helped us stay on track and create effective deadlines
- Document meetings with to-do lists
  * Since not everyone can make each and every meeting, having notes and summaries of each of our meeting was helpful for ensuring all team members know what had occurred during the meeting (transparency to all team members)
  * This also allowed us to be organized and make sure that we are on time with all of our goals. Also allowed to see the status of each task and weâ€™re able to go back to it and update it whenever needed as it is very accessible

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- More in-person meetings
  * Because it is a busy time for all team members (i.e. midterms and other assignments are due the same weeks) not everyone could meet up so some team members are missing during the meetings
  * To ensure that the missing team members are still updated on what happened, we have meeting notes (as seen above)
- Group calls
  * Since not everyone could meet in person we tried to schedule a group call for a meeting
  * This did not turn out well because we were unable to find a block of time that worked best for everyone and some of us had connectivity issues when we tried to do it (i.e. some were on a bus going home or had to use mobile data instead of wifi so connection was not as stable)
  * We used Slack to communicate instead and set up in-person meetings with as many people as we could, if not everyone could make it we just referred to notes and updated each other through Slack

#### Planned changes

- Since this is the end of the project we do not have any planned changes going into the demo. We just hope to continue to meet as often as we can to do the final touches on the website and fix any outstanding bugs as well as test the website. We also hope to meet and rehearse the presentation and demo.
- We are overall happy with the process that our team has created for ourselves. We find that it works well for our schedules and our individual work ethic and skills

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- [x] Plan the structure of the Database
  * We figured out the structure during one of our meetings. See notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zOfXyDPRUwhEV487oZ4rNPb98VLpQ2N-CPbKDftwTCg/edit
- [x] Create Git Issues and assign to pairs
- [x] Create the Database and set up the environment and integrate it with your website (mongoDB)
  * We hosted the database on mlabs (The username and password for the database can be found in the link above)
- [x] Research information and get the information and populate the database
  * All research can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Q85iDZC2nZJe2MqR8azJs9AwTiorgmpVjKw2tlV5PA/edit?usp=sharing
- [x] Create a txt files which are summaries of the service (will be loaded into the website for users to see when they click on a node)
- [x] Set up Express and routing for our application
- [x] Use Ajax to integrate Front-end and Back-end
  * Add the functionality of search (EXTRA) and favoriting (PRIORITY) and filtering (PRIORITY)
- [x] Change Sign Up to Register + link User db to login
- [x] Finalize Styling
- [x] Write voice over script
  * This can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXtw4lkkkLVVEENbV7gx-4_Do697up5cTxZdK31r2OY/edit?usp=sharing
- [x] Film and edit demo video
  * Video can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/shsi16c2uer2s0r/CSC301%20Group%2021%20Deliverable%203.mov?dl=0

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- Search function for our web pages
  * This is a bonus feature that is not imperative for the operation of the website, users are still able to understand how the website works and we are able to create a demo without this feature
  * The search functionality is intended to search for a service in a big database. For our purposes and our database size, this is not a priority.
- UTORid authentication
  * The API for UTORid authentication is a large learning curve and we realized it would take a lot more time than we have
  * For time management purposes we were not able to get to it, but if we were to develop this further, this would be at a high priority


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Meet as often as we can to polish the product
  * We will also take the time to fix any outstanding bugs and test the website as much as possible so that it runs smoothly during the demo
  * Make sure our code and repository is cleaned (ie. no unnecessary comments, temp variables, or unneeded files)
  * Make sure that the final styling is polished and is presentable
- Prepare for demo
  * To prepare for the demo we will try to meet briefly before and talk about how and what we are going to show
  * Meet up for a practice run of our presentation and ensure that we have a laptop that can connect to the projectors in Bahen Centre (make sure one of us has an adapted if needed i.e. vga to hdmi adapter)
- Adding more data to the database
  * At the moment our database is relatively small, we hope to include more categories and services in order to capture and better represent the accessibility services that are available at UofT
